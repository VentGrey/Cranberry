.SH NAME
cranberry - find console logs in TypeScript files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cranberry
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcranberry\fR is a tool to find occurrences of console logs in TypeScript files.
By default, it will search for files recursively in the current directory.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-d, --dir <path>\fR
Directory to examine. Default is current directory.

.TP
\fB-r, --remove\fR
[Experimental] Remove offending lines of code.

.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Display a help message.

.SH EXAMPLES
To search for console logs in a specific directory:

.B cranberry -d /path/to/directory

or

.B cranberry --dir /path/to/directory

To delete the offending lines from all of the files in your project:

.B cranberry -d /path/to/directory -r

or

.B cranberry --dir /path/to/directory --remove

This program won't detect logs that are console.error() as there is a valid reason to show them. Comments that contain any console.log() will be treated as errors. The -r, --remove flag is highly experimental and may delete the whole line where the console log is located. Check your code for possible breakages.
