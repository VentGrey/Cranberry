# üçí Cranberry

Cranberry is a small Go program that helps you find console logging statements in your TypeScript project.

This has been tested in the following frameworks:

- Angular 
- React
- Svelte
- Vue
- Solid.js

## üåü Features

Cranberry can:

- Find `console.log()`, `console.table()`, `console.warn()`, `console.info()`, and `console.debug()` statements in your TypeScript code.
- Display the file path, line number, and line contents of each console statement it finds.
- Count the number of console statements found and display a summary at the end.
- [EXPERIMENTAL] Remove the offending lines in your project directory.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
cranberry [options]
```

### üìú Options

- `-d`, `--dir <path>`: Directory to examine.
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help message.
- `-r`, `--remove`: Remove offending lines.

## How it works

Cranberry looks for `.ts` (TypeScript) files recursively in the directory you specify (or the current directory by default) and checks each file for the following console methods:

- `console.log()`
- `console.table()`
- `console.warn()`
- `console.info()`
- `console.debug()`

If it finds any of these methods, but not `console.error()`, it will print the offending line(s) with the file name and line number.

## Installation

We found 2 incidents!
```
